# numbeo-puppeteer
A Simple JavaScript City Data Scraper

This is jsut a small project to test out some of the main features offered by Puppeteer to scrape some data from Numbeo.

In order to run the script you first have to install the puppeteer library with the `npm install puppeteer` command (or also via `yarn add`) and then run `node scrapper.js`.

Enjoy!
